# spotify-end-to-end-data-pipeline-project-python
This project showcases an ETL pipeline using the Spotify API and AWS services. Data is extracted from Spotify API, transformed with AWS Lambda, and stored in Amazon S3. AWS Glue catalogs the data, enabling queries via Amazon Athena. The pipeline automates data retrieval, processing, and analysis in a structured format.
